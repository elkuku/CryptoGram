An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
Bad news travels fast
Bad money drives out good
Barking dogs seldom bite
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Actions speak louder than words.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
All good things must come to an end
A picture is worth a thousand words
A watched pot never boils
Beggars can’t be choosers
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Don’t bite the hand that feeds you
Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.
Don’t judge a book by its cover
Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket
